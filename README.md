# GCB-2022-WS1

Here you can find the Jupyter Notebooks for the [course](https://gcb2022.de/GCB2022_Workshops.html) we held at the GCB 2022 in Halle (Saale). 
Notebooks are flagged as PracticalsI and PracticalsII dependent on the morning (I) and afternoon (II) session where they are referred to.
_Exercises notebooks lack the solution of the posed tasks while _Solutions notebooks donÂ´t :).
